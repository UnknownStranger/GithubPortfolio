  <ul>
    <li>A card is a gameplay mechanic used by a healer class, and is a player action that increases damage that can be applied to players.
    <li>FFLogs is a third party API for parsing gameplay logs. This service provides both an analysis of these gameplay logs and access to their parsed output. Oauth2 is used to obtain bearer tokens, which allows access to the API. This data was then imported into MongoDB. The data was then parsed using D3JS to render a graph to show card usage per person over time.
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Using JavaScript with P5.js drawing library and matter.js 2d physics engine, completed multiple book based projects related to recursion, object oriented programming, physics calculations - both with an engine and bespoke code.
  </ul>

<a href = "https://github.com/UnknownStranger/MazeGen">Maze Generator:</a>
  <ul>
    <li>Working off an existing algorithm, I used P5.js to create my own implementation and visualize the steps taken to generate a maze using recursive backtracking.
  </ul>
  
<a href = "https://github.com/UnknownStranger/AsciiConversion">Ascii Image Converter:</a>
  <ul>
    <li>Using PIL to get the brightness values of each pixel, and numpy to handle the array manipulation. Create an ASCII string for a given image file.
  </ul>
